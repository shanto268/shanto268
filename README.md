# About Me:

-  I am an Applied Physics and Mathematics Major (Computer Science Minor) at Texas Tech University (May 21) 
-  I work at the Advanced Particle Detector Laboratory (APDL) as an undergraduate researcher working for the Muon Tomography group. Currently, I am working on developing Monte Carlo simulations for three prototype Muon Telescopes in development at our lab. I am also working on data analysis using the CAMAC HEP system and designing ML algorithms for better muon track reconstruction and ensuantly finer image generation.
- I also work as a Teaching Assistant for the graduate level *"Introducion to Quantum Computation and Information"* class at Texas Tech University.
- I am also doing research in Quantum optimization as a part of my senior Capstone project. I am studying the potential connections between Quantum Walk algorithms, Jacob's optimization algorithm and parameterized circuits to design robust and efficient Quantum Optimization and Machine Learning models.

- Random fact: I believe the moon exists just because a rat looks at it.
